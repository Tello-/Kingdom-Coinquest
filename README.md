  <img width="80" align='left' src="HeartKing.png">
</p>
<p align='center'>The leader of your Kingdom. He must be protected at all cost. <br /> The King starts with 20 health points. A king is defeated when he has 0 or less health. The final King standing is the victor.

<p>
  <img width="80" align='left' src="HeartQueen.png">

<p align='center'> The king's right hand. She has vowed to protect her people and their way of life. <br /> The queen will fully absorb 1 incoming attack, in <b>all</b> cases where a knight is not available to defend the king. <br /> The Queen stays in play until defeated.
