  <img width="80" align='left' src="HeartKing.png">
</p>
<p align='center'>The leader of your Kingdom. He must be protected at all cost. The King starts with 20 health points. A king is defeated when he has 0 or less health. The final King standing is the victor.
</p>

<p align='center'> <b>Non-Player Kings:</b> 
<br />
These kings are not used in game, they are set aside outside of the play area. </p>
<br />


---

### __Queen__

<p>
  <img width="80" align='left' src="HeartQueen.png">
</p>

<p align='center'> The king's right hand. She has vowed to protect her people and their way of life. The queen will fully absorb 1 incoming attack, in <b>all</b> cases where a knight is not available to defend the king. The Queen stays in play until defeated. A defeated queen is then discarded to the <b>bottom</b> of the graveyard. <b>Note: Only 1 Queen can be active per player at a time.</b>
</p>

<br />

The act of resurrection and the subsequent immediate play of the ressurected card, constitutes 1 <b><i>play move</i></b>. Aces used to resurrect, must be placed at the bottom of the discard pile. Do not shuffle the discard pile when placing an Ace at the bottom of the pile. <b><i>Note: Ressurected cards do not need to be prepared by the quartermaster</i></b>
</p>

### __Equipment (Numbered Suits)__

These cards represent weapons and armor. The [Quartermaster](#Quartermaster) prepares these resources for use by your Peasant or Knight. The value of the card influences its effect and preparation cost.

### __Recruited Cards__

A pair of cards not of your kingdom's suit of arms. They count as individual cards until played together. Playing the 2 cards together is known as <b>recruiting.</b> A recruited card can be played as a card of your suit.
