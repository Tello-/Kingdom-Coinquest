<h1 align='center' id="PlayFieldHeader"> <strong><u>Play Field</u></strong></h1>
<h2><u>Forge</u> : </h2>
<p> <li align='left'>The Forge is your primary source for stocking your hand each turn. The Forge <br /> deck is 1 of the 3 places you can draw from during the first phase of your turn.</p>

<h2><u>Graveyard</u> : </h2>
<p> <li align='left'>The Graveyard is a community shared discard pile.  The Graveyard <br /> serves a dual purpose. It is also 1 of 3 places you can choose to draw from <br /> during the Draw Phase of your turn. The Graveyard is always stacked face up and <br /> only the top card is accessible at any time.

---

(<b>Be careful! Anything you discard to the Graveyard, is then retrievable during the draw phase of a rival kingdom's turn!</b>)</p>

---

<h2><u>Salvage Yard</u> : </h2>
<p> <li align='left'>There are 3 spots in your area of the play field labeled "Salvage". These are <br /> aditional discard slots which can hold 1 card each. These cards can be retrieved <br /> just like drawing from the Forge or the Graveyard. However, your Salvage Cards <br /> are only accessible to you. 

---

(<b>Note: Only 1 card per Salvage spot. 3 total salvage cards per player at any time. </b>)

<h1 align='center' id="CardTypesHeader"> <strong><u>Card Types</strong></u> </h1>



<h2 id="KingHeader" align='center'><b><u>King</u></b></h2>
 <p>
  <img width="80" align='left' src="HeartKing.png">
</p>
<p align='center'>The leader of your Kingdom. He must be protected at all cost. <br /> The King starts with 20 health points. A king is defeated when he has 0 or less health. The final King standing is the victor.
</p>

<p align='center'> <b><u>Non-Player Kings:</u></b> 
<br />
These kings are not used in game, they are set aside outside of the play area. </p>
<br />


---

<h2 id="QueenHeader" align='center'><b><u>Queen</u></b></h2>

<p>
  <img width="80" align='left' src="HeartQueen.png">
</p>

<p align='center'> The king's right hand. She has vowed to protect her people and their way of life. <br /> The queen will fully absorb 1 incoming attack, in <b>all</b> cases where a knight is not available to defend the king. <br /> The Queen stays in play until defeated. A defeated queen is then discarded <br /> to the <b>bottom</b> of the graveyard. <br /><i><b>Note: Only 1 Queen can be active per player at a time.</b></i>
</p>

<br />

<h2 id="AceHeader" align='center'><u>Ace</u></h2>

<p>
  <img width="80" align='left' src="AceHeart.png">
</p>

<p align='center'>
The ace of your suit can be used to resurrect the top card from the graveyard and place it on your unit of choice for immediate use. The act of resurrection and the subsequent immediate play of the ressurected card, constitutes 1 <b><i>play move</i></b>. Aces used to resurrect, must be placed at the bottom of the discard pile. Do not shuffle the discard pile when placing an Ace at the bottom of the pile. <b><i>Note: Ressurected cards do not need to be prepared by the quartermaster</i></b>
</p>

<br />

---

<h2 id="EquipmentCardHeader" align='center'><b><u>Equipment Cards (numbered suits)</u></b></h2>

<p align='center'>
These cards represent weapons and armor. The <a href="#QuartermasterHeader">Quartermaster</a> prepares these resources for use by your Peasant or Knight. The value of the card influences its effect and preparation cost.
</p>

---

<h2 id="RecruitedCardHeader" align='center'><b><u>Recruited Cards</u></b></h2>

A pair of cards not of your kingdom's suit of arms. They count as individual cards until played together. Playing the 2 cards together is known as <b>recruiting.</b> A recruited card can be played as a card of your suit.

<h2 align='center' id="QuartermasterHeader"> <strong><u>Quartermaster</strong></u> </h2>

<p align='center'>The preparer and provider of weapons and armor for your Knights and Peasants. <br /> Each resource needs to be prepared by the Quartermaster in order to be used. <br /> An <a href="#EquipmentCardHeader"> Equipment Card </a> of your kingdom's Suit of Arms can be played on your Quartermaster. <br /> Depending on the value of the Equipment Card, the preparation cost varies. The cost of preparation is paid in turns.


---

<h3 id="PreparationCostsHeader"><strong><u>Preparation Costs</u> <i>(based on numeric card value)</i></strong></h3>
<li> 2-4 	= 1 turn preparation </li>
<li> 5-7 	= 2 turns preparation </li>
<li> 8-10 	= 3 turns preparation </li>

---

__Tip__: Place the Equipment Card being prepared by your Quartermaster sideways as shown in the diagram. Then immediately place enough counters on top of the card to represent how many turns of preparation are remaining.

__Tip__: Removing 1 counter from your Quartermaster should be the first thing you do each turn.

<h2 align='center' id="KnightHeader"> <strong><u>Knight</strong></u> </h2>

<p align='center'>Defender of the King. Play a piece of equipment on your Knight in order to provide defense for your King. When an opponent attacks, your Knight is required to defend the King.
