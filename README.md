<h1 id="SynopsisHeader" align='center'> <strong>-<u>Synopsis</u>-</strong></h1>
<h3 align='center' id="GoalHeader"><strong><u>The Goal:</u></strong></h3>
<p align='center'> of Kingdom Coinquest is to defeat your rival kingdoms. Players will draw until they have 3 cards in hand each turn. Choose strategically the source from where you draw your cards. You have 3 options, The Forge(deck), The Graveyard (community discard) or your Salvage Yard (your set of 3 personal discard slots). The cards in hand could be Equipment Cards, Queen Cards, Jack Cards or Ace Cards. Each card type is outlined in it's own section. You can only play a card of your Suit of Arms unless you have 2 cards of a Rival Kingdom in your hand. 2 cards of a Rival Kingdom can be played as 1 card of your own Suit. This is known as Recruiting. After you make your play, you must discard a card from your hand. This discard can be placed in 1 of 2 places. If you discard to the Graveyard, other players will have a chance at accessing the card in the future. If you discard to 1 of the 3 personal Salvage Yard slots, only you can access these cards in the future. However, space is limited in the Salvage Yard. Only 3 cards total can be stored here.</p>
<h3 align='center' id="VictoryHeader"><strong><u>Victory is accomplished by:</u></strong></h3>
<p align='center'>playing Equipment Cards on your Quartermaster to be prepared for use by your Knights and Peasants. Once prepared an Equipment card can then be equipped to either your Knight or your Peasant, during your Play Phase. Use your Peasants to attack a rival kingdom. Use your Knight to defend your King. Once a King has depleted his 20 health points, he is no longer in play. Be the last King standing and you are victorious!</p>

<h1 align='center' id="SetupHeader"> <strong>-<u>Set-Up</u>-</strong> </h2>


!["GameSetup"](GameSetup.png)

---

### This setup will be duplicated by each player. __(Note: Forge and Graveyard are community piles!)__

---
  1) Set aside Joker Cards
  2) Separate the 4 Kings from the deck.
     1) Shuffle the Kings and place them face down.
     2) Each player in turn then draws their king for the game.
     3) Place your King as shown in the figure above.
     4) Set the remaining Kings aside for the remainder of the game.
  3) Shuffle the remaining cards that are the non-kings/non-joker.
     1) This is the <b>forge</b>. It is essentially the deck that players will draw from.
     2) Place the forge in the location indicated in the figure above.

---

### __Note__: At this point, each player should have 1 King in front of them and there is only one deck of cards face down, in the location labeled "forge" on the set-up figure.

<h1 align='center' id="PlayFieldHeader"> <strong>-<u>Play Field</u>-</strong></h1>

<h2 id="ForgeSlotHeader"><u>Forge</u> : </h2>
<p> <li align='left'>The Forge is your primary source for stocking your hand each turn. The Forge <br /> deck is 1 of the 3 places you can draw from during the first phase of your turn.</p>

---

<h2 id="GraveyardSlotHeader"><u>Graveyard</u> : </h2>
<p> <li align='left'>The Graveyard is a community shared discard pile.  The Graveyard <br /> serves a dual purpose. It is also 1 of 3 places you can choose to draw from <br /> during the Draw Phase of your turn. The Graveyard is always stacked face up and <br /> only the top card is accessible at any time.

---

(<b>Be careful! Anything you discard to the Graveyard, is then retrievable during the draw phase of a rival kingdom's turn!</b>)</p>

---

<h2 id="SalvageYardSlotHeader"><u>Salvage Yard</u> : </h2>
<p> <li align='left'>There are 3 spots in your area of the play field labeled "Salvage". These are <br /> aditional discard slots which can hold 1 card each. These cards can be retrieved <br /> just like drawing from the Forge or the Graveyard. However, your Salvage Cards <br /> are only accessible to you. 

---

(<b>Note: Only 1 card per Salvage spot. 3 total salvage cards per player at any time. </b>)

---

<h2 id="QuartermasterSlotHeader"><u>Quartermaster Slot</u> : </h2>
<p> <li align='left'>1 card may be played here at a time. A card played here enters preparation. Equipment cards must be prepared by the Quartermaster in order to then be equipped to your Knight or Peasant in a future Play Phase. The only time a card will not need to be prepared by your Quartermaster is when you play an Ace Card. An Ace can Resurrect the top card of the Graveyard directly onto the Knight or Peasant.  </p>

---

<h2 id="KnightSlotHeader"><u>Knight Slot</u> : </h2>
<p> <li align='left'>Equipment cards played here act as Armor. Armor is used to protect your King from attacking rivals. An Equipped Knight is required to defend his King. Once a Knight has seen battle, the equipment card must be placed on the top of the Graveyard (Note: This is not a Discard Move). <br /> ->See section on <a href="#BattleHeader">Battle for more information.</a></p>

---

<h2 id="PeasantSlotHeader"><u>Peasant Slot</u> : </h2>
<p> <li align='left'><a href="#EquipmentCardHeader">Equipment Cards</a> played here act as Weaponry. Weaponry is used to attack rival kingdoms. An Equipped <a href="#PeasantHeader">Peasant</a> can use their weapon only <u>once</u>. After a Peasant has seen battle, their weapon breaks and is placed on the top of the Graveyard.  The opposing players response is dependent on what they have available for defenses. An opposing player can block some or all of your Peasants attack with his/her Knight or Queen if avaiable. <br /> ->See section on <a href="#BattleHeader">Battle for more information.</a></p>

---

<h3><strong>Note: You don't attack the rival King, only the rival Kingdom.</strong></h3>

---

<h2 id="QueenSlotHeader"><u>Queen Slot</u> : </h2>
<p> <li align='left'>Your <a href="#QueenHeader">Queen</a> is the last line of defense for your King. A Queen played in this slot, will absorb all damage done to your King one time. A Kingdom with no Knight <strong>MUST</strong> be defended by your Queen. A Queen that has seen battle must then be placed at the very bottom of the Graveyard.</p>

---

<h2 id="KingSlotHeader"><u>King Slot</u> : </h2>
<p> <li align='left'>Simply the place where your <a href="#KingHeader">King</a> sits.</p>
